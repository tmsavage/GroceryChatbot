# GroceryStoreChatbot

**This is a different, drastically simplified project than the Chatbot I produced at Canary Medical**

Meet Phil! He is a GPT Chatbot model here to help with any questions you have regarding Fitty Groceries.

Playing around with GPTs! I'm making steady progress on this chatbot on sample data. Follow along!

Fine-tuning Phil on the products_new.csv dataset.

## Things to add to README
- How do I get from fine-tuning to a working GPT model
- What are the steps to train my model? Dependencies?
- How do I load the demo on my machine?


Some Code Segments are referenced from the following deeplearning.ai courses:
- Building Systems with the ChatGPT API
